- Parses each string into a multiaddress object and appends it to the result slice.  
  
### Type: Config  
  
- Represents the configuration of the application.  
- Contains the following fields:  
    - RendezvousString: A unique string to identify a group of nodes.  
    - BootstrapPeers: A list of multiaddresses for bootstrap peers.  
    - ListenAddresses: A list of multiaddresses for listening for incoming connections.  
    - ProtocolID: A string representing the protocol ID for stream headers.  
  
### Function: ParseFlags  
  
- Parses command-line flags and returns a `Config` object.  
- Sets default bootstrap peers if none are provided.  
  
### Summary:  
  
This code defines a custom flag parser for handling a list of multiaddresses and a `Config` struct to store the application's configuration. It also includes a function to parse a list of strings into multiaddress objects. The `ParseFlags` function parses command-line flags and returns a `Config` object, setting default bootstrap peers if none are provided.

### Code Summary:  
  
1. **Initialization and Configuration:**  
   - The code initializes a logger and sets the log level for the "rendezvous" package.  
   - It parses command-line flags and retrieves the topic name from the `topicNameFlag` variable.  
  
2. **Libp2p Host Creation:**  
   - A new libp2p host is created using the `libp2p.New` function.  
   - The host is configured to listen on TCP and UDP ports, and it enables NAT port mapping, hole punching, and relay services.  
  
3. **DHT Initialization and Peer Discovery:**  
   - A DHT is initialized using the `initDHT` function.  
   - The DHT is bootstrapped using a list of default bootstrap peers.  
   - The code then uses a routing discovery mechanism to find and connect to other peers who have announced their presence on the specified topic.  
  
4. **Message Handling and Streaming:**  
   - The code sets up a subscription to the specified topic and handles incoming messages.  
   - It also provides a function to send messages to the topic and a function to stream console input to the topic.  
  
5. **Main Function:**  
   - The main function starts a goroutine to handle the relay, and then it starts the libp2p host.  
   - It joins the specified topic, sends a test message, and handles incoming messages.  
  
6. **Helper Functions:**  
   - The code includes helper functions for sending messages to the topic, handling incoming messages, and streaming console input to the topic.  
  
7. **Error Handling:**  
   - The code includes error handling for various operations, such as connecting to peers, publishing messages, and receiving messages.  
  
8. **Logging:**  
   - The code uses the `log` package to log messages at different levels, such as debug, info, and warn.  
  
9. **Concurrency:**  
   - The code uses goroutines to handle multiple tasks concurrently, such as peer discovery, message handling, and console input streaming.  
  
10. **Command-Line Flags:**  
   - The code uses the `flag` package to parse command-line flags, allowing users to specify the topic name and other options.  
  
11. **Data Structures:**  
   - The code uses various data structures, such as `peer.AddrInfo` and `pubsub.Topic`, to represent peers and topics.  
  
12. **Networking:**  
   - The code uses the libp2p library to handle networking tasks, such as connecting to peers, sending and receiving messages, and managing the DHT.  
  
13. **Concurrency Control:**  
   - The code uses synchronization primitives, such as mutexes and channels, to control access to shared resources and ensure thread safety.  
  
14. **Error Handling and Recovery:**  
   - The code includes error handling and recovery mechanisms to handle potential issues, such as network failures and peer disconnections.  
  
15. **Logging and Debugging:**  
   - The code uses logging to provide information about the program's execution and to aid in debugging.  
  
16. **Documentation and Comments:**  
   - The code includes comments and documentation to explain the purpose of various functions and data structures.  
  
17. **Code Style and Formatting:**

# relay.go  
## Package: main  
  
### Imports:  
  
* context  
* fmt  
* log  
* github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p  
* github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht  
* github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/p2p/host/autonat  
* github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/p2p/protocol/circuitv2/relay  
* github.com/multiformats/go-multiaddr  
  
### External Data and Input Sources:  
  
* The code uses the libp2p library to create a new libp2p Host.  
* It also uses the libp2p-kad-dht library to create a DHT (Distributed Hash Table).  
* The code uses the autonat library to create an AutoNAT (Automatic Network Address Translation) service.  
* The code uses the circuitv2/relay library to create a relay service.  
  
### Summary of Major Code Parts:  
  
#### Starting the Relay:  
  
1. The code first creates a new libp2p Host using the libp2p.New function.  
2. It sets up the host with the following options:  
    * ListenAddrs: Specifies the addresses to listen on for incoming connections. In this case, it uses both TCP and UDP addresses.  
    * NATPortMap: Attempts to open ports using uPNP for NATed hosts.  
    * EnableHolePunching: Enables hole punching for NAT traversal.  
    * EnableNATService: Enables the NAT service.  
    * EnableRelayService: Enables the relay service.  
3. After creating the host, the code instantiates the relay service using the relay.New function.  
4. It then creates a DHT using the dht.New function.  
5. Finally, it creates an AutoNAT service using the autonat.New function.  
6. The code then prints a message indicating that the relay has started and displays the Bootstrap ID of the host.  
7. The code then enters an infinite loop using the select {} statement, which effectively keeps the program running indefinitely.
